<h1>Game Grid and CSS</h1>

loop to make a grid with a length and width that could defined with a constant.</p>

<p>I have user input by dragging and dropping the ships onto 
their own grid as well as the "Start Game" and "Rotate Ships" buttons.</p>

<h1>Mouse Clicks</h1>
<p>When choosing a position on the oppenents board is how I used Mouse Clicks.</p>

is used by updating the status of the game and whose turn it is.</p>
